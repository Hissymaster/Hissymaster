Hey there!
I'm an australian highschooler that has the hopes and dreams of being a developer!
I would definitely not call myself very... good? right now? But I'll try my best.

I know python and web languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

### What am I working on?
Nothing right now. and considering I am a high schooler I might not be fore a long while.
